Some simple exercises on machine learning using __scikit-learn__. Each exercise is run within a jupyter notebook. Here is a summary of each exercise

## Exercises
  * __00__ Prepare Higgs boson data for subsequent training and testing in exercise 03.
  * __01__ Use the __AdaBoost__ algorithm to build a boosted decision tree to classify good and bad wine based on two variables. Illudtrate the optimization of the choice of training parameters and decision tree attributes by randomly sampling from a set of possible parameters and evaluating the classifier using 3-way cross validatation.
  * __02__ Create a (9, 50, 25, 1) 3-layer regression network to estimate the quality of white wine.
  * __03__ Create a classifier to discriminate between *Higgs* to *ZZ* to 4*l* and *ZZ* and between the vector boson fusion and gluon gluon fusion production of the Higgs boson.
  * __04__ Create a classifier to classify the hand-written digits in the MNIST database.
  * __05__ A simple 1-d illustration of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method, which is used in the creation of Bayesian neural networks.
